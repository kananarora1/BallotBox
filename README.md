# BallotBox

**BallotBox** is a decentralized voting application built on the blockchain that offers a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof way to conduct elections. The system enables users to cast their votes in an election directly from a digital wallet, ensuring a trusted and verifiable voting process.

The application makes use of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to guarantee that once a vote is cast, it cannot be altered, deleted, or fraudulently changed. The power of decentralization makes the electoral process more accessible and secure, removing the need for intermediaries while maintaining full transparency.

## Key Features

- **Secure & Transparent Voting**: All votes are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, providing an immutable, publicly accessible record of votes.
- **User-Friendly UI**: A seamless and simple interface built with React, allowing users to vote in elections easily and intuitively.
- **Web3 Integration**: Direct interaction with Ethereum smart contracts using Web3.js for transactions and authentication through popular wallets like MetaMask.
- **Tamper-Proof**: Smart contracts ensure that every vote is counted correctly and cannot be altered after submission.
- **Vote Authentication**: Users can cast their votes only after wallet-based authentication, ensuring each individual can only vote once.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Redux, Web3.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Smart Contracts written in Solidity)
- **Development Tools**: Truffle Suite, Ganache, Remix IDE
- **Hosting**: Vercel, GitHub Pages

## How It Works

1. **Deploy the Smart Contract**: The Ethereum smart contract governs the voting system, handling the voting process, vote counting, and preventing vote tampering.
2. **Voting Process**: Voters interact with the platform through a React-based front-end. The platform is connected to their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to securely handle transactions.
3. **Voting System**: Users select a candidate or party to vote for and submit their vote through the smart contract. The Ethereum network records each vote on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust.
4. **Results Transparency**: Once voting is closed, the results are stored on the blockchain, accessible to anyone for verification, ensuring a fair outcome.
